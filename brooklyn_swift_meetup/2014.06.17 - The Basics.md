# Brooklyn Swift Dev Meetup: The Basics

Etsy Labs
June 17, 2014

---

* Swift vs Objective-C
	* Namespaces
		* Class names scoped to module (i.e. framework)
			* no more class proof fixes
	* Type Safety
		* Compiler performs type checks to find mismatched types
		* Allows for type inference
		
			```
			var heyStr = "Hey"
			
			```
	* CLosures
		* Nameless function constructed as another function's argument
		* Equivalent to blocks
	* Tuples
		* Group multiple values to single value
			* Sounds like an array
			* What's cool about it is that you can assign multiple types to it
		* Supports multiple types
* Playground
	* One of the coolest features of Xcode 6
	* Offers a lot of things that will help developers write more efficient apps
	* It's an interactive coding environment for testing
	* Offers immediate feedback

### Data Types

* Immutable (Constant)

	```
	let monthsInYear = 12
	```
* Mutable Variables

	```
	var daysInMonth = 31
	daysInMonth = 30
	```
* Float

	```
	let implicitFloat = 1.5
	```
	
	* implicit because we're not defining the type
	
	```
	let explicitFloat Float = 10
	```
* Double Float
	* Float can't handle too large of number, so use double instead
* Strings

	```
	let title = "Swift Developers Meetup"
	```
	* String Interpolation
	
		```
		let monthStr = "There are \(monthsInYear) months in a year!"
		```
* Array

	```
	var musicGenres = ["pop", "metal", "punk", "anklecore"]
	```
	
	* Update array
	
		```
		musicGenres[3] = "bluegrass"
		```
	* To view new array, just type it
	* Add to array
		* Reference key
	
			```
			tourDates["7/4"] = "Philadelphia, PA"
			```
	* Define empty arrays
		* You need to define arrays with datatypes
		
			```
			var emptyArray = Int[]()
			```
			
			```
			var emptyDictionary = Dictionary<String, Integer>()
			```
* Control Flow
	* If Statements
	
		```
		let numShows = 4
		if tourDates.count < numShows {
    		println("More dates to book")
		} else if tourDates.count == numShows {
    		println("Tour is fully booked")
		} else {
    		println("Tour is overbooked")
		}
		```
	* For Loop
		* Based on order of variables and type it can figure out what it's associated with. 
			* first var is key, second value
			
			```
			for (date, city) in tourDates {
    			println("\(date): \(city)")
			}
			```
			
	* Switch Statements
		* Can compare many types of data
		* If you want to look at a string and figure out if the prefix contains a character string, you can and assign a case to it
	* Optionals 
	
		```
		if let name = bandName {
    		println("Please welcome to the stage... \(name)")
		} else {
    		println ("Please welcome to the stage... TBD")
		}
		```
* Functions
	* Define with keyword func
	* Specify input types and return type
	
		```
		func fanCount(city: String, numFans: Int) -> String {
    		return "\(numFans) fans came to the \(city) show!"
		}
		fanCount("NYC", 1000)
		```
* Visuals
	* Set Color
	
		```
		let blueColor = NSColor.blueColor()
		```
	* Building web view to show site and want to see how it looks
	* Image editing
		* You typically want to edit your own resources
		* Playground lets you do that
			* View>Utilities>Show File Inspector
			* You can change resources path from here
				* Use inside playground because you can edit them inside playground, pack them up and send to dev friends so everything is packaged together
		* Defining image and displaying
		
			```
			let metalImg = NSImage(named: "rvp")
			let metalImgView = NSImageView(frame: NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 				metalImg.size.width, height: metalImg.size.height))
			metalImgView.image = metalImg
			```
			
### Go Through a Sample Project

* 	still need some obj-c ideas
	* 	arc, object model, target/action
* 	need swift ideas
	* functions, generics, static dispatch, immutable data
